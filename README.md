This project is a simple and easy-to-use URL shortener built using React. When users open the site, they’ll see a clean homepage with a text box where they can paste any long link. After entering a URL and clicking the button, the app instantly returns a shorter version of that link, which they can easily copy and share.

The interface is designed to be smooth and user-friendly. There’s no need to reload the page — everything updates right away. If the input is empty or invalid, the app shows clear messages to guide the user. It’s built to feel responsive and simple for anyone to use.

The overall layout of the project is well-organized with different sections for different parts of the app, like the homepage and stats page. Everything is kept clean and easy to maintain. This project is a great example of how a basic idea like shortening URLs can be turned into a real, working web app.
